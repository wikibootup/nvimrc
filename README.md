# nvimrc

## Philosophy

1. Use VIM as **simple** and **useful** as possible.

- Keep it as one file (No import runtime).
- No add Plugins which makes vim slow.
- Add Autocmds only if necessary.

2. Package manager priority
  - VIM(plug) >= OS(brew) > NODE(npm)

## Pre-requisites

- [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/)
