Word search
<S-#> at the word

NERDTREE
Key 't'(cursor at the nerdtree navigation bar) makes new tab in the top

EMMET
emmet_expandabbr_key
  - is working on n,i mode
  - the key binding '<C-y>,' I interpreted as 'a rest' before completion

Yank & Clipboard
  - To copy into clipboard, I use <C-c>, <C-x>, <C-v>
  - To yank, just y. I commented 'unnamedplus' to seperate purpose.

VIM jsdoc
  - I force to insert input prompt when :JsDoc
    I think it is faster & explicit way.
    But if want to create empty format, press ESC or ENTER continuosly.

Tagbar
- TagbarOpen may cause a delay for the large file, Toggle off(or turn off) if
  you mind that.

Autocompletion
I use following plugins together for various languages and frameworks.
  - Deoplete
  - nvim-completion-manager

Process speed(bottleneck) check
(1) ':syntime on'
(2) ': syntime report'

Plugins I do not use 'for some reason'
- 'othree/yajs.vim' : It makes javascript embedded in html very slow (2017, september 5).
